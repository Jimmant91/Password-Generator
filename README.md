## About
Essentially, this code can be ran with only one function within the EventListener. All user input variables were defined first, along with a Password Criteria object outside of the generatePassword function. The finished result is returned to the content box as one single string. I would like to update my JS code section of combinations for selections to simply the code and remove unnecessary lines. I know there is a way to do this as a few simple if statements and pushing selecting criteria to an array, but I could not figure it out fo this instance.

Additional comments are in the JS file.
